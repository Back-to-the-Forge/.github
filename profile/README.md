# Welcome 

Welcome to the **Back to the Forge** project!

![Back to the Fabric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Back-to-the-Forge/.github/main/pictures/banner.png "Project logo")

We do ports, we do backports, we do back to (the) Forge ports!

And we do love puns.

_(yes, it is all Minecraft mods)_

# About us

This project was launched by [Nerjal Nosk](https://github.com/NerjalNosk) at the end of 2022, and aims to bring a bunch of Minecraft mods to [Forge](https://fabricmc.net) from other modloaders, or just update them from old Minecraft versions.

## Our members

As of today, our team regroups a total of <n>1</n> person, and aims to grow bigger, to provide always more mod ports to the community.

As for the community itself, we approximate it to a total of <n>0</n> members. _Numbers from the [Discord](#Our-Discord) server_

## Our activities

We here do mod ports to the Minecraft [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) modloader, but we also do ports to other modloaders: 
* [Back to the Fabric](https://github.com/orgs/Back-to-the-Fabric)
* [1.21 Quiltawatts](https://github.com/orgs/1-21-Quiltawatts)

# Disclaimers

* The whole project was originally created as [Back to the Fabric](https://github.com/orgs/Back-to-the-Fabric), but expanded to other modloader in order to stay open-minded towards all modloaders. The name was born out of the `Back to the Future` pun, while bringing back one originally Fabric-compatible mod to the Fabric toolchain.

* :warning: All of our ports are unofficial unless marked as such. All licensing belongs to the original mod owners, but we are responsible for all mod support towards our ports. If, and only if, an error is actually caused by the code of the original mod contained in one of our port, then we would pass the report along to the real developer, if they still work on their mod.

* We are by no means in a position to pass any demand to original mod owners. If you wish to see some modification occur in a mod we ported, you shall ask to the original mod owner to have it done. Only our own mods will include content of our own.
